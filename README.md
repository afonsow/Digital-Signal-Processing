# Digital-Signal-Processing
Voice controled lock for a door/gate

This a small project made with the intent of testing digital singal processing and signal filtering. An audio file is filtered and speech recognition is apllied to the filtered audio. If the recognised speech is the not so secret passkey, the door will open (ask gently). 

After the filtering and speech recognition, the recognised key is sent through RF transmitter/receiver for the logic of the door to be handled by an esp8266 board.
This is an unfinished project.
